                        I think my greatest strength as a team member is that I am willing to set myself as role model to take initiative
                        to cope with various challenges. When our team falls behind,
                        I would motivate them by assisting them to overcome their difficulties through giving out clear guidance. 
                        Thanks to the others coordination and cooperation, we finish the task nicely and decently. <br><br>
                        The group work skills I plan to work to improve are:<br>
                        My sensitivity. Accomplish a team project with 3 other members from different countries is a challenge , 
                        not only do we have to overcome the time restraint but also the pressure from the due date. 
                        It is imperative for me to have great sensitivity to understand what my team needs and what the other expect from me. 
                        Therefore, having good awareness and be more sensible would be helpful to finish any group work.

                It is in my opinion that CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is a quantitative measure. 
                The point that assigned to a vulnerability is a numerical value that indicates the relative severity of the vulnerability. 
                The CVSS score is calculated based on various of qualitative and quantitative factors, across from complexity of the attack 
                required to exploit the vulnerability, the potential threat of the vulnerability, and the number of users or systems impact 
                (NIST, 2022). Nonetheless, as it is measured in a numeric value (0-10), 
                it may fall under the category of quantitative measurement... <a href="dis2.pdf">Read More</a>
